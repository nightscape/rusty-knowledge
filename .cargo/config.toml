# Cargo configuration for rusty-knowledge
# Tests MUST run sequentially due to network resource conflicts

# This doesn't work - cargo doesn't support setting test-threads in config
# But documented here for reference:
# [test]
# test-threads = 1

# Alternative: use alias to make sequential testing easy
[alias]
# Run tests sequentially (required for this project)
test-seq = "test -- --test-threads=1"

# Android NDK configuration for cross-compilation
