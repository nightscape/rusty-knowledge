## Quick Reference

### Repository Interface Summary
15 methods to implement across 4 categories:

**Reading (5)**: getRootBlocks, findBlockById, findParentId, findBlockIndex, getTotalBlocks

**Writing - Root (3)**: addRootBlock, insertRootBlock, removeRootBlock

**Writing - Any (3)**: updateBlock, toggleBlockCollapse, removeBlock

**Hierarchy (4)**: addChildBlock, moveBlock, indentBlock, outdentBlock

**Special (1)**: splitBlock

### Block Model
```dart
Block(
  id: String,              // UUID v4
  content: String,         // Text
  children: List<Block>,   // Nested blocks
  isCollapsed: bool,       // UI state
  createdAt: DateTime,
  updatedAt: DateTime,
)
```

### Main Widget
```dart
OutlinerListView(
  config: OutlinerConfig(...),
  blockBuilder: (context, block) => ...,
  editingBlockBuilder: (context, block, controller, focusNode, onSubmitted) => ...,
  bulletBuilder: (context, block, hasChildren, isCollapsed, onToggle) => ...,
  // ... 5 more builder callbacks
)
```

### State Operations
```dart
Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, child) {
    final notifier = ref.read(outlinerProvider.notifier);
    notifier.addRootBlock(Block.create(content: 'New'));
    notifier.indentFocusedBlock();
    notifier.moveBlock(id, parentId, index);
    notifier.splitBlock(id, cursorPosition);
    // ... 10+ more operations
  },
)
```

## Integration Paths

### Path 1: REST API Backend
- Implement OutlinerRepository with HTTP calls
- Simple and widely compatible

### Path 2: gRPC Backend
- Implement OutlinerRepository with gRPC stubs
- Higher performance for large datasets

### Path 3: Native Platform Channel
- Bridge to native Rust code
- Maximum performance for complex operations

### Path 4: Testing/Demo
- Use provided InMemoryOutlinerRepository
- Perfect for initial development and testing

---

## Dependencies

Required (must add to pubspec.yaml):
- flutter_riverpod: ^2.6.1
- hooks_riverpod: ^2.6.1
- flutter_hooks: ^0.20.5
- freezed_annotation: ^2.4.4
- json_annotation: ^4.9.0
- uuid: ^4.5.1

Optional dev dependencies:
- build_runner, freezed, json_serializable (code generation)

---

## Important Notes

### Performance
- All blocks loaded at startup (suitable for KB-MB datasets)
- Every operation reloads all blocks (intentional simple design)
- Riverpod efficiently rebuilds only affected widgets
- For huge datasets, implement pagination in repository

### Architecture
- No hardcoded Material/Cupertino dependencies
- Platform-agnostic (you control all UI)
- Clean separation: Model → Repository → Notifier → Widget
- Immutable state (Freezed) prevents mutation bugs

### Constraints
- Cannot move block into its own descendants (prevents cycles)
- Keyboard shortcuts only on desktop/web (disable on mobile)
- Collapsed state is UI-only (not persisted by default)

### Gotchas
1. Both hooks_riverpod AND flutter_hooks required
2. Every operation causes full reload (design choice)
3. No automatic persistence (you provide repository)
4. Mobile needs custom UI buttons instead of keyboard shortcuts
5. Use copyWith() for immutable model updates

4. **Design**: Plan your backend API for block operations (30 min)
5. **Implement**: Create RustyOutlinerRepository (2-4 hours)
6. **Test**: Verify with InMemoryOutlinerRepository first
7. **Integrate**: Connect to Rusty Knowledge app UI
8. **Deploy**: Test end-to-end

## Questions & Clarifications

### Q: Is this library complete?
**A**: Yes, v0.1.0 is stable and feature-complete. All core functionality is production-ready.

### Q: Can I customize the UI?
**A**: Yes, completely. All UI is customizable via builder callbacks. No subclassing needed.

### Q: How do I persist blocks?
**A**: Implement OutlinerRepository interface. Connect to REST API, gRPC, native channel, or database.

### Q: Can I use this with large datasets?
**A**: Yes, but implement pagination/lazy-loading in your repository. The library loads root blocks.

### Q: Is keyboard support good?
**A**: Yes on desktop/web (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter). Mobile needs custom UI buttons instead.

### Q: Can I add custom features?
**A**: Yes, via builder callbacks. For advanced needs, implement custom repository.

### Q: What if I need rich text editing?
**A**: Use editingBlockBuilder callback to provide a custom editor.

### Q: How's the testing?
**A**: Comprehensive property-based tests included. All structural invariants verified.
