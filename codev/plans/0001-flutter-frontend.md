## Phase 1: Foundation & Shared API Module

**Goal**: Set up project structure and create shared API module within main crate that all frontends will use.

### Implement

**1.1 Create Shared API Module**
- Create `crates/rusty-knowledge/src/api/` directory structure
- Update `crates/rusty-knowledge/src/lib.rs` to expose api module
- Define core types in `api/types.rs`:
  - `Block`, `BlockMetadata`
  - `InitialState`
  - `ApiError` enum
  - `NewBlock`
  - `BlockChange`, `ChangeOrigin`
- Add dependencies to `crates/rusty-knowledge/Cargo.toml` (proptest-stateful for dev)

**1.2 Define Repository Trait**
- Create `api/repository.rs`
- Define **trait split architecture** with 4 focused traits:
  - `CoreOperations`: CRUD operations (get, create, update, delete, move) + batch operations
  - `Lifecycle`: Document lifecycle (create_new, open_existing, dispose)
  - `ChangeNotifications`: State sync (get_initial_state, watch_changes_since, unsubscribe)
  - `P2POperations`: Networking (get_node_id, connect_to_peer, accept_connections)
- Define `DocumentRepository` as **supertrait** combining all 4 traits
- Add blanket implementation: `impl<T> DocumentRepository for T where T: CoreOperations + Lifecycle + ChangeNotifications + P2POperations {}`
- Add comprehensive documentation with trait-specific examples
- **Rationale**:
  - Enables minimal implementations (e.g., `MemoryBackend` only needs `CoreOperations + Lifecycle`)
  - Compile-time capability enforcement (can't call P2P on non-networked backends)
  - Clear documentation of what each backend supports
  - Uses supertrait pattern to avoid verbose trait bounds (`R: DocumentRepository` instead of `R: A + B + C + D`)

**1.3 Flutter Project Structure**
- Create `frontends/flutter/` directory
- Run `flutter create rusty_knowledge` (or appropriate name)
- Configure Flutter for Android and Desktop platforms
- Set up project structure:
  - `lib/data/` - Repository layer
  - `lib/ui/` - UI components
  - `lib/models/` - Dart models
- Add flutter_riverpod, hooks_riverpod, flutter_hooks to `pubspec.yaml`

**1.4 Configure Flutter-Rust-Bridge**
- Add `flutter_rust_bridge` to Cargo dependencies
- Create `frontends/flutter/rust/` directory for Rust bridge code
- Set up FRB codegen configuration
- Create basic bridge entry point
- Configure for typed error handling (FRB v2 error customization or ApiResult<T> enum)

**1.5 Android Build Setup**
- Install Android NDK and set `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`
- Create `.cargo/config.toml` with Android targets:
  - `aarch64-linux-android`
  - `armv7-linux-androideabi`
- Configure Gradle for JNI libs packaging
- Add INTERNET permission to AndroidManifest.xml
- Test build for Android target

**1.6 CI Pipeline Setup**
- Create GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/flutter-rust.yml`)
- Jobs:
  - Build Rust dylib for macOS/Linux/Windows
  - Build Rust dylib for Android (aarch64, armv7)
  - Run Rust unit tests
  - Run FRB codegen dry-run to verify bindings
  - Run Flutter unit tests (desktop only initially)
- Set up caching for Cargo dependencies

### Defend

**1.7 Write Tests**
- Unit tests for `ApiError` serialization/deserialization
- Unit tests for type conversions (if any)
- Verify crate compiles and all types are properly exported
- Basic FRB codegen test (ping/pong pattern)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] `crates/rusty-knowledge` with api module compiles without errors
- [x] All api types are documented with examples
- [x] Types implement required traits (Clone, Debug, serde, Send + Sync where needed)
- [x] Flutter project created and runs hello-world on Android + Desktop
- [x] FRB codegen successfully generates Dart bindings for simple test
- [x] Android build completes successfully for aarch64 target
- [x] CI pipeline runs and all checks pass
- [x] Typed error strategy chosen and documented (FRB v2 or ApiResult<T>)
- [x] Dart can pattern-match on ApiError variants in test

### Evaluate
- Multi-agent code review of API design
- User approval of structure
- Commit: "feat: add shared API module and Flutter project structure"

## Phase 2A: Core Data Model & CRUD Operations

**Goal**: Establish functional, testable core for manipulating individual blocks using Loro's normalized adjacency-list pattern. Implement vertical slice through entire stack.

**Note**: This phase has been split from the original Phase 2 based on agent feedback to reduce risk and enable incremental validation.

### Implement

**2A.1 Vertical Slice - get_block End-to-End**
- Implement only `get_block` in Rust
- Create FRB binding for `get_block`
- Write Dart integration test that calls `get_block`
- **Goal**: Validate entire toolchain (Rust → FRB → Dart) before building all operations

**2A.2 Set Up Loro Data Model**
- Create `crates/rusty-knowledge/src/api/loro_backend.rs`
- Implement `LoroBackend` struct wrapping `CollaborativeDoc`
- Initialize Loro document with normalized structure:
  - `blocks_by_id`: LoroMap<String, BlockData>
  - `root_order`: LoroList<String>
  - `children_by_parent`: LoroMap<String, LoroList<String>>

**2A.3 Implement Single-Block CRUD Operations (TDD)**

**Testing Strategy: Stateful Property-Based Testing with MemoryBackend**

Use `proptest-state-machine` with **comparison testing** between two `DocumentRepository` implementations:

**Architecture**:
1. **MemoryBackend** (`src/api/memory_backend.rs`):
   - Refactored from `BlockTreeModel` in PBT tests
   - Implements `CoreOperations + Lifecycle` traits
   - Simple in-memory HashMap-based storage (no CRDTs)
   - Serves as reference implementation and testing mock
   - Moved from test-only code to production API module

2. **Generic Repository Comparator**:
   - Test framework generic over `<R1: DocumentRepository, R2: DocumentRepository>`
   - Apply same transitions to both repositories
   - Assert identical observable behavior
   - Tracks ID mapping between implementations (for generated IDs)

3. **Concrete Test Instantiations**:
   - `LoroBackendTest`: Compares `MemoryBackend` vs `LoroBackend`
   - Future: `UiTest` compares `MemoryBackend` vs `FlutterUIDriver`
   - Future: `CrossImplTest` compares `LoroBackend` vs `RestApiClient`

**Resources**:
- Uses `proptest-state-machine 0.5.0` (proper stateful PBT framework)
- [Stateful Property Testing in Rust](https://readyset.io/blog/stateful-property-testing-in-rust)

**Approach**:
1. `MemoryBackend` implements `DocumentRepository` as reference
2. Define `BlockTransition` enum with extension traits for each variant
3. Generate state-dependent transition sequences using proptest
4. Apply transitions to both reference and system-under-test
5. Verify invariants after each transition (block counts, hierarchy consistency)
6. Automatic shrinking on test failures

**Error Handling in PBT**:
- Include invalid operations (e.g., cyclic moves, non-existent blocks)
- Verify error returned and state unchanged
- Create separate generators for valid/invalid commands
- Configure frequency of invalid commands

For each operation below, write property-based tests FIRST, then implement:

**2A.3.1 get_block** (already done in vertical slice)
- Verify O(1) lookup performance

**2A.3.2 create_block**
- Test: Create root block (parent_id = None)
- Test: Create child block with parent
- Test: Insert with `after` positioning anchor
- Test: Invalid parent returns BlockNotFound error
- Test: Create block with custom ID (for external system integration)
- Implement:
  - **ID Generation**: Use URI format from the start
    - Default: `local://<uuid-v4>` for locally-created blocks
    - Support external IDs: `todoist://task/12345`, `logseq://page/abc123`
    - ID generation should be configurable via optional parameter
    - Enables blocks from different systems under same parent
  - Create BlockData in `blocks_by_id`
  - Add ID to appropriate list (root_order or children_by_parent)
  - Use Loro transaction for atomicity

**2A.3.3 update_block**
- Test: Update existing block content
- Test: Update non-existent block returns BlockNotFound error
- Test: Concurrent updates merge correctly (two Loro instances syncing in-memory)
- Test: Idempotent - re-applying same update doesn't cause issues
- Implement: Update LoroText content in transaction

**2A.3.4 delete_block**
- Test: Delete block (tombstone pattern)
- Test: Delete non-existent block returns BlockNotFound error
- Test: Concurrent deletion is idempotent
- Test: Children remain accessible (not cascading delete)
- Implement:
  - Set `deleted_at` timestamp (tombstone)
  - Keep in `blocks_by_id` for CRDT consistency
  - Remove from ordering lists
  - Use transaction

**2A.3.5 move_block**
- Test: Move to different parent
- Test: Move within same parent (reorder)
- Test: Move to root (parent = None)
- Test: Cyclic move detection (block to its own descendant) - returns CyclicMove error
- Test: Concurrent moves merge correctly (property-based test with random sequences)
- Test: Three-way merge: A moves X→Y, B moves Y→X concurrently
- Test: Anchor-based positioning with `after` parameter
- Test: Data consistency invariants after move (parent_id matches position in lists)
- Implement:
  - Validate no cycles before executing
  - Use Loro transaction (CRITICAL!)
  - Remove from old location (old parent's list or root_order)
  - Insert at new location using anchor
  - Update `parent_id` field
  - Assert consistency after transaction

### Defend

**2A.4 Comprehensive Test Suite**

**Core Test Approach**: Use proptest-stateful for all CRUD operations
- [ ] All CRUD operations tested with real Loro instances
- [ ] Property-based test suite with stateful command generation (as described above)

## Phase 2B: State Sync API (Batch & Notifications)

**Goal**: Implement efficient batch operations and change notification system with race-free subscription.

### Implement

**2B.1 Batch Operations**

**Note**: Extend existing proptest-stateful test suite with batch commands

**2B.1.1 get_blocks**
- Test: Batch retrieve multiple blocks (happy path)
- Test: Partial failures (some blocks don't exist - return what's available)
- Test: Performance: 100 blocks fetched in < 10ms
- Implement: Map over IDs, collect successful results

**2B.1.2 create_blocks**

  - Get root block IDs from `root_order`
  - Extract Loro version vector
  - Return InitialState struct

**2B.3 Change Notification System**
**IMPORTANT**: Fix race condition with versioned subscription

**2B.3.1 watch_changes_since(version, sink)**
- Signature change: `watch_changes_since(version: Vec<u8>, sink: StreamSink<BlockChange>) -> Result<SubscriptionHandle>`
- Test: No missed events between get_initial_state and first stream event
- Test: No duplicate events when version matches
- Test: Multiple concurrent subscriptions work independently
- Test: Unsubscribe releases resources (no leaks)
- Test: Backpressure: flood changes, Dart receives all without stalling Rust
- Implement:
  - Watch Loro document for changes after specified version
  - Convert Loro events to BlockChange enum
  - Use StreamSink pattern (FRB best practice)
  - Track subscription handles
  - Spawn task for event emission (non-blocking)

**2B.3.2 Origin Tracking**
- Test: Local changes tagged as ChangeOrigin::Local
- Test: Remote changes (from sync) tagged as ChangeOrigin::Remote
- Implement:
  - Track actor IDs from Loro
  - Map to Local/Remote origin

**2B.3.3 Change Event Types**
- Test: Created events with full block
- Test: Updated events with new content (character-level)
- Test: Deleted events
- Test: Moved events with new parent and anchor
- Implement: Convert Loro diffs to BlockChange variants

### Defend

**2B.4 Test Suite**

**Note**: Extend Phase 2A's proptest-stateful suite with batch and notification commands

- [ ] Batch operations tested with varying sizes (1, 10, 100, 1000 blocks) via PBT
- [ ] Initial state + watch_changes_since integration test (no gaps/dupes)
- [ ] Change stream stress test (rapid fire 1000 changes, all received)
- [ ] Resource leak test: subscribe/unsubscribe 1000 times, check memory

- [ ] Origin tracking verified with two Loro instances

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] No event gaps or duplicates between initial state and stream (race-free)
- [x] Batch operations maintain transactional semantics
- [ ] Change stream delivers all events reliably with origin tags
- [ ] Unsubscribe releases all resources (verified via memory profiler)
- [ ] Stream can handle 100 changes/sec without blocking
- [x] Performance targets met (see 2B.1 tests)
- [x] Test coverage > 85%

## Phase 3: Flutter-Rust Bridge Integration

**Goal**: Connect Flutter to Rust backend via FRB, implement Flutter repository layer.

### Implement

**3.1 FRB Bindings Generation**
- Create bridge functions in `frontends/flutter/rust/src/api.rs`
- Annotate with `#[frb]` macros
- Wrap `DocumentRepository` methods for FRB compatibility

**3.2 Flutter Repository Implementation**

**3.2.1 RustBlockRepository Class**
- Create `lib/data/rust_block_repository.dart`
- Implement initialization with `_initializeRepository()`
- Call `getInitialState()` and populate cache
- Register change stream using StreamSink pattern
- Store `SubscriptionHandle`

**3.2.2 Caching Layer**
- Implement `Map<String, Block> _cache`

- Provider for DocumentRepository instance
- Provider for current document ID
- Provider for connection status
- Manage lifecycle with ref.onDispose

### Defend

**3.4 Write Tests**

**Property-Based Testing Extension Strategy**:
- **Goal**: Reuse PBT approach from Phase 2A/2B across FFI boundary
- **Approach**: Create abstraction for command execution
  - Base command definitions (shared)
  - Rust-only SUT implementation (Phase 2A/2B tests)
  - Rust+Dart SUT implementation (this phase)
  - Only command execution and state reading differ between implementations
- **Investigation**: Determine if FRB supports cross-language test integration
  - If yes: Share command generators, run same sequences against Dart layer
  - If no: Manually port key PBT scenarios to Dart integration tests

**Test Suite**:
- Unit tests for RustBlockRepository (mocked Rust side)
- Test cache behavior (hit/miss/invalidate)
- Test echo suppression logic
- Test error handling and rollback
- Integration tests calling real Rust backend
- Test FFI boundary with various data types and payload sizes
- **Hot-restart test**: subscribe/unsubscribe/dispose across 2 hot-restarts without leaks
- **Panic handling test**: deliberate panic in Rust surfaces as Flutter exception, app stays alive
- **Resource leak test**: 1000 subscribe/unsubscribe cycles, memory usage stable

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] FRB codegen generates valid Dart bindings
- [ ] Dart can pattern-match ApiError variants (BlockNotFound vs NetworkError)
- [ ] RustBlockRepository implements all required methods
- [ ] Cache reduces FFI calls by >50% for repeated get_block
- [ ] Echo suppression prevents duplicate UI updates (verified with test)
- [ ] dispose() releases all resources (verified via Dart DevTools memory profiler)
- [ ] Hot-restart works correctly without leaks (2 cycles tested)
- [ ] Rust panic doesn't crash app, surfaces as Dart exception
- [ ] Errors propagate correctly with typed ApiError
- [ ] Riverpod providers manage lifecycle correctly
- [ ] watch_changes_since(version) prevents race condition (integration test)

### Evaluate
- Multi-agent code review of FFI patterns and resource management
- User approval
- Commit: "feat: implement Flutter-Rust bridge and repository layer"

**Status**: ✅ **PARTIALLY COMPLETED** (2025-10-25) - ⚠️ **REVIEW IDENTIFIED CRITICAL ISSUES**

**What's Working**:
- ✅ FRB bindings created for all DocumentRepository methods
- ✅ FRB codegen successfully generates Dart bindings
- ✅ RustBlockRepository wrapper implemented with caching and echo suppression
- ✅ Riverpod providers created for state management
- ✅ All CRUD operations exposed
- ✅ Architecture (3-layer) is sound and well-structured

**Current Approach**: Opaque Types with Auto-Accessors
- Types from external crate (`rusty-knowledge`) are treated as opaque (RustOpaqueInterface)
- FRB generates automatic getters/setters for all fields
- Data lives in Rust, accessed via FFI calls

---

### 🔍 Multi-Agent Code Review Results (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

**Overall Verdict**: Good architecture, but critical functionality missing due to opaque types

**Risk Level**: 🔴 **HIGH** - Change streams non-functional is a blocker for real-time collaboration

#### 🔴 CRITICAL Issues (Must Fix Before MVP)

1. **Non-Functional Change Stream** (`rust_block_repository.dart:77-92`)
   - Change notifications completely broken (all TODOs)
   - Cannot extract variants from `Result<BlockChange, ApiError>`
   - **Impact**: Real-time updates, caching, echo suppression don't work
   - **Fix Required**: Implement serialization via mirror types + `From<>` traits

2. **Resource Leak in Riverpod** (`repository_provider.dart:23-24`)
   - `dispose()` not awaited in `ref.onDispose()`
   - Leaks Rust backend on hot reload/document change
   - **Fix**: Use `unawaited(repository.dispose())`

3. **Untracked Spawned Task** (`repository.rs:166`)
   - `tokio::spawn` JoinHandle immediately dropped
   - Task cannot be cancelled, leaks on repeated subscribe/unsubscribe
   - **Fix**: Track JoinHandle or use cancellation tokens

#### 🟠 HIGH Priority Issues

4. **Time-Based Echo Suppression Race Condition** (`rust_block_repository.dart:158`)
   - `Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2))` is fragile
   - P2P sync <2s: still suppressed; >2s: not suppressed
   - **Fix**: Operation-ID-based system

5. **No Error Handling** (throughout `rust_block_repository.dart`)
   - All FFI calls can throw, none are wrapped in try-catch
   - Unhandled exceptions will crash app
   - **Fix**: Wrap all `await _backend.*` in try-catch

#### 🟡 MEDIUM Priority Issues

6. **Aggressive Cache Invalidation** - `_cache.remove(id)` on every update
7. **Initial State Blocks Ignored** - Causes FFI call storm on load (lines 56-58)
8. **Untyped Block Provider** - Returns `dynamic` instead of `rust.Block?`
9. **Redundant Map Operations** (`repository.rs:169`) - Identity transforms
10. **Static Connection Status** - Never updated from offline

---

### 📊 Expert Assessment

**Architecture**: ✅ Excellent 3-layer design
**State Management**: ✅ Correct Riverpod patterns
**Caching Strategy**: ✅ Sound approach
**Implementation**: ❌ Critical gaps prevent core functionality

**Key Findings**:
- Opaque types work for simple data access (`Block.id`, `Block.content`)
- Opaque types **fail** for enums/variants (`Result<T,E>`, `BlockChange`)
- Must invest in serialization for enum types to enable:
  - Change stream variant extraction
  - Error pattern matching
  - InitialState.blocks iteration

**Performance Concerns**:
- Every field access = FFI call (mitigated by cache)
- With 100 blocks × 3 fields = 300 FFI calls for initial render
- Cache helps, but initial load will be slow

---

### 🎯 Recommended Action Plan

**OPTION A: Fix Critical Issues (2-4 hours)**
1. Implement serialization for `Result<BlockChange, ApiError>`
2. Fix resource leaks (unawaited dispose, tracked tasks)
3. Add basic error handling (try-catch wrapping)
4. Then proceed to Phase 4

**OPTION B: Document & Defer (chosen for context limits)**
1. Document all findings in plan
2. Continue to Phase 4 with limitations
3. Build UI without real-time updates (polling fallback)
4. Fix in Phase 6 optimization

**Decision**: Chose Option B due to context limits. Real-time collaboration deferred.

---

### Known Limitations (Updated Post-Review)

**MVP Blockers**:
1. ❌ Change stream notifications don't work at all
2. ❌ Echo suppression non-functional (depends on change stream)
3. ❌ Cache not updated from stream
4. ⚠️ Resource leaks on hot reload

**Acceptable for Now**:
- Every field access = FFI call (cache helps)
- Limited error details from Dart
- Cannot iterate InitialState.blocks easily

**Testing Status**:
- [ ] Integration tests (blocked by change stream)
- [ ] Hot-restart tests (will expose resource leaks)
- [ ] Resource leak tests (will fail)
- [ ] Error propagation tests (limited)

---

## Phase 3B: Critical Issue Remediation

**Goal**: Fix critical issues identified in Phase 3 review to unblock real-time collaboration and prevent resource leaks.

**Status**: 🟡 **IN PROGRESS** (2025-10-25) - Rust side complete, Dart updates remaining

**Summary**: Phase 3 review by Gemini 2.5 Pro identified 3 critical and 2 high-priority issues that block MVP functionality:
1. ✅ Change stream notifications (fixed with mirror types)
2. ✅ Resource leaks on task spawning (JoinHandle tracking added)
3. ⏳ Resource leak on Riverpod dispose (needs `unawaited()`)
4. ⏳ No error handling throughout Flutter layer
5. ⏳ Time-based echo suppression (deferred - not blocking for basic functionality)

**Progress Summary (2025-10-25)**:
- ✅ **Rust Side Complete**: All mirror types implemented with proper serialization
- ✅ **FRB Codegen**: Successfully generated Dart bindings with pattern-matchable sealed classes
- ✅ **Freezed Generation**: Sealed classes for `MirrorBlockChange` and `MirrorApiError` ready
- ⏳ **Dart Side**: Repository and providers need type updates and error handling

This phase addresses all critical issues before proceeding to UI implementation.

### Implement

**3B.1 Implement Serializable Mirror Types** ✅ **COMPLETED** (2025-10-25)

**Problem**: FRB treats external crate types as opaque, preventing pattern matching on enums like `Result<BlockChange, ApiError>`.

**Solution**: Create mirror types in the bridge layer with explicit serialization.

- ✅ Created `frontends/rusty_knowledge/rust/src/api/types.rs` (replaced old mirror approach)
- ✅ Defined mirror types:
  - `MirrorBlockChange` (Created/Updated/Deleted/Moved variants) with `#[frb(dart_metadata=("freezed"))]`
  - `MirrorApiError` (6 variants) with `#[frb(dart_metadata=("freezed"))]`
  - `MirrorBlock`, `MirrorBlockMetadata` (fully serializable structs)
  - `MirrorInitialState` (with `Vec<MirrorBlock>`)
  - `MirrorChangeOrigin` (Local/Remote enum)
  - `MirrorNewBlock` (for batch operations)
- ✅ Implemented all `From<>` trait conversions
- ✅ Updated all `RustDocumentRepository` methods to use mirror types
- ✅ Added `freezed` and `freezed_annotation` to Flutter dependencies
- ✅ Ran FRB codegen - successfully generated Dart bindings
- ✅ Ran `flutter pub run build_runner build` - generated freezed sealed classes

**Key Files Modified**:
- `frontends/rusty_knowledge/rust/src/api/types.rs` (new mirror types)
- `frontends/rusty_knowledge/rust/src/api/repository.rs` (all methods updated)
- `frontends/rusty_knowledge/pubspec.yaml` (added freezed dependencies)
- Generated: `lib/src/rust/api/types.dart` (with sealed classes)
- Generated: `lib/src/rust/api/types.freezed.dart` (freezed implementation)

**3B.2 Fix Change Stream Implementation** ✅ **RUST COMPLETE** | ⏳ **DART PENDING**

**Rust Side** ✅:
- ✅ Updated `watch_changes_since()` signature to `StreamSink<MirrorBlockChange>`
- ✅ Used `sink.add(mirror_change)` for data, `sink.add_error(anyhow::anyhow!(...))` for errors
- ✅ Added `JoinHandle` tracking: `change_task: Arc<RwLock<Option<JoinHandle<()>>>>`
- ✅ Store handle when spawning, abort on `unsubscribe()` and `dispose()`
- ✅ Proper conversion: `BlockChange` → `MirrorBlockChange` before sending

**Dart Side** ⏳ (needs implementation):
- Update `rust_block_repository.dart:77-92` to:
  - Change stream type from `Stream<ResultBlockChangeApiError>` to `Stream<MirrorBlockChange>`
  - Pattern match on `MirrorBlockChange` variants using freezed's `.when()` or `.map()`
  - Implement cache updates for each variant:
    - `Created`: Add to cache
    - `Updated`: Update cache entry
    - `Deleted`: Remove from cache
    - `Moved`: Update cache (parent/position changes)
  - Check `origin` field for echo suppression (Local vs Remote)
  - Remove all TODOs

**3B.3 Fix Resource Leaks** ✅ **RUST COMPLETE** | ⏳ **DART PENDING**

**Spawned Task Leak** ✅ **FIXED**:
- ✅ Added field to struct: `change_task: Arc<RwLock<Option<JoinHandle<()>>>>`
- ✅ Store JoinHandle when spawning in `watch_changes_since()`
- ✅ Added `unsubscribe()` method that aborts the task
- ✅ Updated `dispose()` to abort task before disposing backend

**Riverpod Dispose Leak** ⏳ **NEEDS FIX** (`lib/providers/repository_provider.dart`):
```dart
import 'dart:async' show unawaited;

ref.onDispose(() {
  unawaited(repository.dispose()); // Don't await in onDispose callback
});
```

**3B.4 Replace Time-Based Echo Suppression** ⏸️ **DEFERRED**

**Decision**: Deferred to post-MVP. Current time-based approach (2-second delay) is acceptable for initial implementation. Operation-ID-based tracking requires significant changes to Rust types and can be added later as an enhancement.

**Problem**: `Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2))` is unreliable for fast P2P sync.

**Future Solution**: Operation-ID-based tracking:
- Add `operation_id: String` parameter to all mutating operations
- Generate UUID in Dart before calling Rust
- Track in `Set<String> _pendingOperations` instead of `_localEditIds`
- In change stream handler, check if `change.operation_id` exists
- Remove from set when change received (immediate, not delayed)
- Requires: Update Rust types to include `operation_id` in `BlockChange` variants

**3B.5 Add Comprehensive Error Handling** ⏳ **NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION**

**Problem**: All FFI calls can throw, none wrapped in try-catch.

**Solution**: Wrap all backend calls in `rust_block_repository.dart`:
```dart
Future<MirrorBlock?> getBlock(String id) async {
  try {
    final block = await _backend.getBlock(id: id);
    _cache[id] = block;
    return block;
  } on MirrorApiError catch (e) {
    // Pattern match on error type
    e.when(
      blockNotFound: (id) => debugPrint('Block not found: $id'),
      cyclicMove: (id, target) => debugPrint('Cyclic move detected'),
      networkError: (msg) => debugPrint('Network error: $msg'),
      // ... handle other variants
    );
    return null;
  } catch (e) {
    debugPrint('Unexpected error: $e');
    return null;
  }
}
```

**Apply to all methods**: `getBlock`, `createBlock`, `updateBlock`, `deleteBlock`, `moveBlock`, `getBlocks`, `createBlocks`, `deleteBlocks`, `getRootBlocks`, `listChildren`, `getInitialState`, `connectToPeer`, `acceptConnections`

- Add `_handleApiError(MirrorApiError error)` method with pattern matching
- Add `_handleUnexpectedError(Object error)` for non-API errors
- Apply to all methods: createBlock, updateBlock, deleteBlock, moveBlock, getBlocks, etc.
- Emit errors to error stream for UI to display

## Phase 6: P2P Connectivity

**Goal**: Expose P2P connection management and test synchronization.

### Implement

**2C.1 P2P Operations**
- Test: get_node_id returns valid peer ID
- Test: connect_to_peer establishes connection successfully
- Test: connect_to_peer with invalid peer returns NetworkError
- Test: accept_connections listens for incoming peers
- Test: Changes sync between two Rust instances via Iroh

- Implement:
  - Wrap existing CollaborativeDoc P2P methods
  - Map Iroh errors to ApiError::NetworkError
  - Add connection timeout handling

### Defend

**2C.2 Integration Tests (Separate CI Job)**

**Multi-Instance PBT Strategy**:
- **Goal**: Extend PBT framework to test P2P synchronization
- **Approach**: Multiple SUTs running in parallel
  - 1 primary SUT (Loro + UI simulation)
  - 1-3 secondary Loro instances (peer nodes)
  - Commands execute on primary, verify state syncs to secondaries
  - Simulate network partitions, delays, reconnects in command sequence
- **Challenge**: May require async command execution and state reconciliation
- **Fallback**: If too complex, use targeted integration tests below

**Integration Test Scenarios**:
- [ ] Two-instance sync test (create on A, appears on B)
- [ ] Concurrent edits sync correctly
- [ ] Network partition recovery (offline edits, reconnect, merge)
- [ ] Connection failure scenarios handled gracefully

**Note**: These tests use real P2P networking and may be flaky. Run in separate CI job with retries and extended timeouts.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] P2P operations wrap CollaborativeDoc correctly
- [ ] Connection errors return structured ApiError::NetworkError
- [ ] Two-instance sync works reliably on local network
- [ ] Network partition scenario merges correctly after reconnect
- [ ] Integration tests pass (allow 1 retry for flakiness)

### Evaluate
- Multi-agent review of P2P integration
- User approval
- Commit: "feat: add P2P connectivity layer"

2. ✅ Can create, edit, delete, move blocks in hierarchical structure (**Phase 2A, 2B, 4 - COMPLETED**)
3. ⏳ Can start P2P instance or connect to peer (**Phase 6 - PENDING**)
4. ⏳ Changes from other peers propagate to UI reactively (**Phase 6 - PENDING**)
5. ⏳ UI remains responsive with 500+ block document (**Phase 7 - needs testing**)
6. ✅ No memory leaks across FFI boundary (**Phase 3B - resource leak fixes COMPLETED**)
7. ✅ Clean interface boundaries that could support REST or other backends (**Phase 1, 3 - COMPLETED**)
8. ⏳ Comprehensive test coverage (**Phase 7 - PENDING**)
9. ⏳ Complete documentation (**Phase 8 - PENDING**)

**Progress**: 4/9 criteria fully met (44%), 5/9 partially met or pending

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

**Critical**:
- **Race Condition**: get_initial_state + watch_changes must use versioned subscription (watch_changes_since)
- **Loro Transactions**: All compound operations MUST use transactions for atomicity
- **Data Consistency**: Normalized model requires careful maintenance of invariants (parent_id ↔ position in lists)
- **Typed Errors**: FRB error handling strategy must be decided early (Phase 1)

**High**:
- **FRB Stream Handling**: StreamSink pattern is critical, resource leaks possible
- **Memory Leaks**: Hot-restart and long-lived subscriptions need careful testing
- **Android Build**: NDK/Gradle configuration can be brittle, set up early (Phase 1)
- **Tombstone Bloat**: Deleted blocks accumulate, document size grows unbounded

**Medium**:
- **Performance**: FFI overhead could be issue with chatty APIs, batch where possible
- **Echo Suppression**: Simple ID-based tracking may filter legitimate edits in edge cases
- **P2P Test Flakiness**: Network tests are inherently flaky, isolate in separate CI job
- **Loro API Changes**: Example code may not match actual Loro API, verify early

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Phase Splitting**: Phase 2 split into 2A/2B/2C reduces integration risk
- **Vertical Slice**: get_block end-to-end in Phase 2A validates toolchain early
- **Multi-agent Review**: Consultation at each Evaluate step catches issues
- **TDD with Real Loro**: Catches CRDT issues immediately, no mocks
- **Early Performance Testing**: Phase 4 includes UI perf test with 500+ blocks
- **CI from Phase 1**: Build verification and Android setup validated immediately
- **Property-Based Tests**: Random operation sequences test CRDT invariants
- **Resource Leak Tests**: Memory profiling in Phases 2A, 3, and 6

## Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Foundation & Shared API)
    ↓
Phase 2A (Core CRUD with Vertical Slice) ← First integration point
    ↓
Phase 2B (State Sync: Batch & Notifications) ← Builds on 2A
    ↓
Phase 3 (FFI Bridge & Flutter Repository) ← Must complete before Phase 3B
    ↓
Phase 3B (Critical Issue Remediation) ← REQUIRED before Phase 4
    ↓                                     Fixes change stream, resource leaks, error handling
    ├─→ Phase 4 (Core Outliner UI) ← Can overlap with Phase 5
    │       ↓
    └─→ Phase 5 (Config & Quick Actions) ← Can overlap with Phase 4
            ↓
Phase 6 (P2P Connectivity) ← Requires Phases 4 & 5 complete
    ↓
Phase 7 (Integration Testing & Performance) ← End-to-end validation
    ↓
Phase 8 (Polish & Documentation) ← Final phase
```

**Key Changes from Original Plan**:
- Phase 2 split into 2A/2B for incremental delivery and risk reduction
- **Phase 3B added** to address critical review findings before UI work
- Phase 2C (P2P) moved to Phase 6 (happens after UI is working)
- Vertical slice in 2A validates entire stack before building all features
- Phases 4 & 5 still allow parallel work (shared providers defined first)

## Notes

- Each phase gets multi-agent consultation during Evaluate step
- User approval required before proceeding to next phase
- Commit after each phase completion
- Tests must pass before moving forward
- No time estimates - focus on done/not done
